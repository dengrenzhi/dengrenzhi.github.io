<h3>Geography</h3>
<p> &nbsp; The island is located in the Caribbean, between the Caribbean Se and the North Atlantic Ocean, east of the Dominican Republic, about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami, Florida.Puerto Rico is almost rectangular in shape, approximately 100 miles long by 35 miles wide and is the smallest and the most eastern island of the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Hispaniola, Jamaica and Puerto Rico).</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<h4>Climate</h4>
<p> &nbsp; Located in the tropics, Puerto Rico enjoys an average temperature of 27 degree throughout the year. The seasons do not change very drastically. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island. The highest temperature record was in the Town of San German with 41 degree and the minimum registration is 4 degree in Aibonito. The dry season spans from November to May while the wet season coincides with the Atlantic hurricane season from June to November.</p>
<h4>Rivers and lakes</h4>
<p> &nbsp; Map of the Piedras Watershed, also known as the San Juan Bay Estuary Watershed (2015), and ends in the San Juan Bay Puerto Rico has lakes (none of them natural) and more than 50 rivers. Most of these rivers are born in the Cordillera Central, Puerto Rico's principal mountain range located across the center of the island. The rivers in the north of the island are bigger and with higher flow capacity than those of the south. The south is thus drier and hotter than the north. These rivers make up 60 watersheds throughout the island, where over 95% of the runoff goes back to sea.</p>
<h4>Flora and fauna</h4>
<p> &nbsp; Map of the ecosystems of Puerto Rico as of 1998, 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians/reptiles have been discovered that are endemic to the archipelago of Puerto Rico. The majority of these are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride are the tree frogs (Eleutherodactylus spp.), small frogs easily recognized by the sound from which they get their name. El Yunque National Forest, a tropical rainforest, is home to the majority of species of tree frogsÂ­. It is also home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic, and 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon (Amazona vittata).</p>

  <h4>Forests</h4>
<p> &nbsp; Forests of Puerto Rico are well represented by the flora of the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), a Long Term Ecological Research Network site managed by the United States Forest Service and University of Puerto Rico. At this site, there are four main life zones, delineated on the basis of temperature and precipitation (Holdridge System), in the Luquillo Mountains: subtropical wet and subtropical rain forests are found at low and mid elevations, lower montane rain and lower montane wet forests at high elevations. There is also an area of subtropical moist forest at low elevations on the southwest slope.</p>
<p> &nbsp; Tabonuco forest, so named for the dominant tabonuco tree (Dacryodes excelsa), covers lower slopes to about 600m. In well-developed stands the larger trees exceed 30m in height, there is a fairly continuous canopy at 20m, and the shaded understory is moderately dense. Tabonuco trees are especially large on ridges, where they are firmly rooted in the rocky substrate and connected by root grafts with each other. There are about 168 tree species in the tabonuco forest.</p>

<h3>Natrual Resources</h3>
<p> &nbsp; The natural resources of Puerto Rico include minerals, stone, sand, ocean waters, tree and crude oil. Another natural resource is the fertile land that is used to grow various crops. Puerto Rico's natural resources are abundant, and the area facilitates many export businesses because of these resources.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The two main minerals found in Puerto Rico are nickel and copper. These minerals are mined and then used in various manufacturing processes, both in Puerto Rico and in other areas of the world. Construction companies use gravel, stone and sand gathered in Puerto Rico for various projects, such as building homes and businesses. Many tourists love the beaches of Puerto Rico, which are also where fish gather for an abundant food supply. Not only does the area supply large quantities of seafood, it also provides access to a large store of crude oil, which is drilled in the ocean waters. This provides jobs and fuel for Puerto Rico's citizens.</p>
<p> &nbsp; The farmlands have soil that is rich in nutrients, allowing nearly year-round growth of various crops. Some of the world's supply of pineapples, coffee, sugarcane and bananas comes from Puerto Rico. Trees for firewood and timber for building are also abundant in the forests.</p>
