		<h1><b><center>Folk custom</center></b></h1>
		<p>Puerto Ricans valued manliness. In Spanish culture, the word "manliness" contains lots of brave behaviors, such as Bullfighting and zoom hunting. It can also mean rude and unreasonable (although is a negative meaning). The manliness in Puerto Ricans doesn't likes the Jewish or Japanese culture, contains knowledge learning, discipline or certain skills. So in Puerto Rican, boys show their manliness by using violence in class or on the streets. It not only happened in Anglo-Saxon communities in Puerto Rican. It happened in everywhere in Puerto Rican.
  Similar as the other races which focus on agriculture only, the Puerto Ricans lack in desire to knowledge. Beside they don't have the long vision to future, so they just follow their fate and show their manliness. This tradition became an obstruction for their getting education. For instance, in 1960, only 12% Puerto Ricans' teenagers finished their middle-school education, it didn't get the 1/2 of black teenagers, 1/3white teenagers.  Also in 1960, only 1% Puerto Ricans finished their education in university. </p>

		<h1><b><center>Differences in human races</center></b></h1>
		<p>The difference of skin colors in Puerto Ricans isn't as serious as mainland America. However, whether the native black people or origin white, they all have differences rules in the Puerto Rico society. In Puerto Rico, the white or the light skin color's people have higher society level than the colored races. That not only caused by history, but also caused by America society. They have a strong feeling to fight for being treated equally, but they don't want to follow the African-Americans. So they keep speaking Spanish and keeping their tradition to avoid to be assimilated, even though, the population of white people in Puerto Rico is much bigger than colored people.</p>

		<h1><b><center>Marriage</center></b></h1>
		<p>In united State, more than 2/5 people are "married in different races". However, the Puerto Ricans seldom married with other race. 85% Puerto Ricans' men married to Puerto Ricans' woman. Others people who didn't married with Puerto Ricans' woman, their wife wasn't a Latin American, too. But in their next generation, the man who didn't married with Puerto Ricans was 1/4 to 1/3 in population.</p>

		<h1><b><center>Society problems</center></b></h1>
		<p>Like other races at the same stage, Puerto Rican's rate of crime, violence and welfare are higher than others. Ratio of Puerto Rican murder, robbery, theft crime is pretty high in New York City residential area. Although Puerto Rican only cover 15% of New York total population, families under the poverty line covers 18%, 40% families depend on "assistance have minor children plan" to live. When Puerto Rican came to America, the social welfare institution has been generally established and various organization advocated welfare rights also contributed to public charity benefit to spread and to vigorously defended. However, in the middle of 1960s, the New York welfare benefit rate of growth in excess of two times the wage growth rate of the manufacturing sector. About 1/3 of the family of Puerto Rico is the head of the household of women (slightly higher than the proportion of blacks).</p>

		<h1><b><center>Language</center></b></h1>
		<p>The general language in Puerto Rico is Spanish and English. 70% of the people there grow up in Spanish-speaking family. This kind of difference bring a lot of problems for the Puerto Rico people when they get education in American schools. They have already created some language programs to solve these problem but their grades are still not as high as those students in America. In order to get rid of these problems, the government also have some policy regard that.
The language problem not only happens in Puerto Rico. Other ethnic groups, for instance, Italian, French Canadians and the west coast of the Mexican living in New England area, for a long time have a large number of members the comings in and out. They also have to maintain the characteristics of a foreign review and exotic culture in the United States.
        <p>Why there are so many people speaking Spanish there?
        <p>Puerto Rico's earliest resident was Arawark and American Indian. In early 16 centuries, Puerto Rico was dominated by Spain, until the middle of 16 centuries, the indigenous were almost extinct. After that, African were poured in there. At the beginning of 19 centuries, Spanish, French and other European immigrated in massively.
